               webserver.py
           written by Claude Pageau

This is a stand alone web server.

Please Note
You will need at least two entries in a folder
before the web server will display content.

This web server can display other types of content
but html files will be displayed full screen.
Web pages with javascript, css Etc will run.
If a folder has an index.html it will take over 
the browser tab.

If a folder is selected on the right pane listing
the folder contents will appear in the existing browser tab.
Select <=BACK link to navigate back through folder structure.   
NOTE: BACK link will not display in web root folder.
Use browser refresh to update web page and display most
recent data.

This browser can only access local raspberry pi
files. It cannot access internet web pages.
